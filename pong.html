  Now, I know that I said I would only put 5 games, but I did say the 5 BEST
  retro games, and while this is good, it isn't one of the best. However, I
  thought I should give it an honorary mention since this is pong. It's the
  first video game ever created that maneged to gain relevance, and started the
  video game industry as a whole, so it managed to sneak it's way onto this
  list.
