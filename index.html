      In this website, I will be talking about the best retro games to play in
      2022, what they are like and why they were chosen. Something quick to
      consider is that this is only my opinion, so it might not reflect what you
      think.<br />(Note: For this article, we will consider retro 20 years ago,
      and from 2022, so the threshold for retro is 2002.) There will also be
      links where you can find websites to download these games on.
