      This game is still popular to this day (Though it is in a different form),
      Tetris. The premisies is very simple: you try to take diffrently shaped
      boxes and put the in a row, at which point they dissaper and you do it all
      over again, until the blocks reach the top at which point the game ends
      and then you restart and do it again. It does seem simple at first glance,
      and honestly a bit tedious, but it's better then you might think because
      there are many different blocks, orders, and ways you can arange them, so
      it alyways feels different and as you go on, the game gets faster, so it
      becomes challenging after a bit also. However, the first couple of rounds can be
      annoying to get through due to their lower speed. For that reason, it has been bonked down to 5.
      It's good, don't get me wrong, just doesnt cut it verses all the other
      ones in my opinion.
